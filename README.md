### **Prepare_Dataset.ipynb**

This is where I prepare the trn.json dataset to add the Description and Title tags and put Desc as INPUT and title as OUTPUT.

### **Fine_Tuning_with_Dataset.ipynb**

This is where I do the Fine Tuning and leave as many comments as possible and it already has the results that gave, I searched for a description that I got from the middle of the test json and it found exactly the name of the product.

### **Prepare_Dataset (In: Title, out: Desc - optional).ipynb**

This is just to show that I could do the reverse with the INPUT being the TITLE and the OUTPUT being the description.

### **Test_without_FineTuning.ipynb**

This is the test without fine tuning, which does not return the name of the product, but rather completes my sentence.
